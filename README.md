## About

This was a practice challenge to work on layout with just HTML and CSS. It represents a sample "social proof section."

I tried to make the page look as good as possible without any CSS. I often hesitate on how to proceed with the markup (do I want to wrap this in a div, etc?). Thinking about the page as if there were no CSS was helpful. Then, I matched the design as close as possible with CSS.
